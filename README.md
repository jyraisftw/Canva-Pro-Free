# Canva Pro Free – Are There Free Options for Canva Pro?
While Canva’s standard plan is free and offers a solid range of tools and templates, Canva Pro is a paid upgrade that provides enhanced features. For users who need advanced design options like the background remover, premium assets, or brand management tools, Canva Pro’s premium plan is ideal. Although there isn’t a permanently free version of Canva Pro, users can access some Canva Pro features temporarily through trials or explore Canva for Education if they’re a student or educator.
